## ‚ú® Features

- üéôÔ∏è Real-time voice-to-text transcription
- üîÑ Dual flow processing:
  - Cold flow: On-demand transcription streams
  - Hot flow: Live session updates
- üìù Structured form data storage
- üîå WebSocket/SSE support for live updates
- üê≥ Dockerized deployment
- üîí OAuth authentication support
- üìä MongoDB integration for data persistence

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB (included in Docker setup)
- Google Cloud Platform account (for OAuth)

### Environment Setup

1. Set up Google OAuth credentials:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google+ API
   - Go to Credentials ‚Üí Create Credentials ‚Üí OAuth Client ID
   - Set up OAuth consent screen
   - Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback` (for local development)
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

2. Configure environment variables:
```bash
# Required OAuth configuration
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
export ALLOWED_EMAILS="user1@example.com,user2@example.com"  # Comma-separated list of allowed emails
export BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"  # Your application's base URL
```

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voizeforms.git
cd voizeforms
```

2. Start the development environment:
```bash
./gradlew run
```

### Docker Deployment

1. Build and run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /api/transcribe` - Submit audio for transcription (cold flow)
- `GET /auth/login` - Initiate OAuth login
- `GET /auth/callback` - OAuth callback endpoint
- `GET /auth/logout` - Logout endpoint

## üîí OAuth Configuration

The application uses Google OAuth for authentication. To configure:

1. Set up Google OAuth credentials as described in Environment Setup
2. Configure the allowed emails using the `ALLOWED_EMAILS` environment variable:
   - Single email: `export ALLOWED_EMAILS="user@example.com"`
   - Multiple emails: `export ALLOWED_EMAILS="user1@example.com,user2@example.com,user3@example.com"`
   - No spaces between emails, just commas
   - Case-sensitive matching

## üß™ Testing

# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific test suite
./gradlew test --tests "com.voizeforms.unit.*"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è CI

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration. Every push or pull request against `main` triggers the workflow located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which:

1. Sets up JDK 21 with Gradle dependency caching
2. Runs `./gradlew clean build` (compile + unit tests)
3. Builds the Docker image to ensure the Dockerfile stays valid

You can extend the workflow later to push container images or deploy automatically.
